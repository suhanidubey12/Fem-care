DESIGN RATIONALE
--------------------------------------------------

The design system balances emotional comfort with technical reliability,
ensuring FEM-CARE feels supportive rather than intimidating. Soft color tones
help reduce cognitive stress, while consistent typography improves clarity
for health insights and AI-driven recommendations.

This system is intentionally minimal and scalable, enabling future feature
expansion without visual inconsistency or user confusion.
